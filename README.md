# Side-Projects
Side projects


This repo is a place for me to keep some of my side projects and ways for me to practice ML modeling and data analysis. Most of it might be sports related but also open to any project as well


Projects Included:
- WAR model: predict player WAR for next season given stats from previous seasons (pybaseball)
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Pitch Type



Future Project Ideas:
- Torpedo bat before and after analysis
- Win probability
- Player Comparison
- Bball is Angel Reece the queen of rebounds?
- Caitlin vs Sab
- Use Poisson distribution to estimate the probability a given number of events occurs
